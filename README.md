## PYTHON FROM THE START

This will include documentation of everything that we would be learning about python, from a beginner perspective to a more advance level. These would be a learning sprint with enough practicals, reading, watching videos, and solving coding challenge using python programming concepts. While learning python, We would also take some algorithm classes to help myself understand some algorithms and to be able to write their implementation with python.
