## PYTHON FROM THE START

This will include documentation of everything that will learning about python, from a beginner perspective to an advance level. These would be a learning sprint with enough practicals, reading, watching, and solving coding challenge using python programming concepts. While learning python, I will also take some algorithm classes to help myself understand some algorithms and to be able to write their implementation with python.
